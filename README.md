# JavaScript Loose Comparison and Null Handling

This example demonstrates a common JavaScript bug related to loose comparison (==) and the handling of null values.  Loose comparison can lead to unexpected behavior when comparing values of different types.

**The Bug:**
The original code might have lacked explicit null checks, leading to incorrect comparisons or unexpected results.

**The Solution:**
The provided solution addresses this by explicitly checking for null values before performing comparisons or operations, thereby ensuring more robust and predictable behavior.

**How to reproduce:**
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the `bug.js` file.
3. Observe the unexpected behavior.
4. Run the `bugSolution.js` file. 
5. Observe the correct behavior.
